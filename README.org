* Tonarchy

A zero-dependency Arch Linux installer with a clean TUI built from scratch in C.

*Status:* Alpha - Beginner (XFCE) and Suckless modes functional, Wayland (Niri) coming soon

* Philosophy

Tonarchy is designed to take users from *zero to hero* with an opinionated beginner mode that sets up a complete, working Linux desktop environment. No choices, no confusion - just a solid foundation to start learning.

For experienced users, the suckless mode provides a minimal dwm setup.

* Installation Modes

** Beginner (XFCE)
Opinionated setup with XFCE desktop, essential applications, and sane defaults. Perfect for your first Linux installation.

** Tony-Suckless (dwm)
Minimal setup with dwm, st, and dmenu built from source. For users who want a lightweight tiling experience.

** Oxidized (Coming Soon)
Wayland-native setup with Niri compositor. Modern, secure, and efficient.
